# ðŸ§© Coding Contest Platform

A full-stack platform designed to host and manage online coding contests with an intuitive user interface and efficient backend processing.  
This project consists of two main parts:
- **Backend:** Developed using **Spring Boot**, containerized via **Docker**.
- **Frontend:** Built using **React.js** for a smooth and dynamic user experience.

The platform allows users to register, log in, participate in contests, and submit coding problems â€” similar to online coding platforms like Codeforces or LeetCode.
